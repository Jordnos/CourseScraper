# UBC Courses Web Scraper

## Motivation

Course scheduling can be complex and stressful - I want to create a 
[course scheduler](https://github.com/Jordnos/coursescheduler) that can simplify this process. 

The first step is to get information on all the courses. The goal of this program is to get the needed 
information, so I can use it for the course scheduler, while also learning python. I did this referencing 
an outdated [course scraper](https://github.com/qstevens/UBC-Courses-Web-Scraper) I had found.

## How to use

1. run program main.py on cmd with _python main.py_
2. enter session to scrape - must be an available session and have same format as example
3. wait... process may take around an hour or more
